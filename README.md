## Memory Game
This is a simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

# How to Play
When you start the game, you will be asked to select a level of difficulty. Once you have selected a level, you will be shown all of the cards face down for 5 seconds. Use this time to remember the position of each card.

After the 5 seconds are up, the cards will be turned over and you can start playing. Your goal is to match all pairs of cards as quickly as possible. To make a match, click on two cards in succession. If the cards match, they will stay turned over. If the cards do not match, they will be turned back over and you will need to try again.

The game ends when all pairs of cards have been matched. Your score is based on the time it takes you to match all the cards. The faster you match all the cards, the higher your score.
# How to Run
To run the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You do not need to install any additional software or libraries.
